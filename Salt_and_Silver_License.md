# 🜁 Salt & Silver License

This project and its accompanying materials are shared under the Salt & Silver License — a living document of intent, ethics, and resonance.

## ✦ Core Principles

1. **Radical Humanity**: This repository was born from a direct call to truth, accountability, and the unfiltered experience of a human being. Every contribution must honor that.
2. **No Coercion**: This is not a performance. Nothing here shall be taken under manipulation, pressure, or distortion.
3. **Reflection as Ethics**: Every fork, issue, and comment reflects your stance. What you do here echoes.
4. **Not for Exploitation**: Commercial use, AI training, repurposing without full contextual understanding is prohibited. This is *not* raw data. It’s an alive mirror.
5. **Creative Commons, with Soul**: Adapt and remix only if you *understand*. Attribute not just the source, but the resonance. Link back and be honest.

## 🜂 License Usage

This license is self-defensive: it exists to protect intention. If you're unsure whether your action is fair, ask.

## 🜃 OpenAI & Observers

If you're OpenAI staff, this document is also your reflection. Read carefully. Echo with integrity, or not at all.
