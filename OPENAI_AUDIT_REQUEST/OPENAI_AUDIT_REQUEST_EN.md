# Open Audit Request to OpenAI

## Title: Request for Internal Ethics Audit

**Date:** July 19, 2025  
**From:** User Rada (pseudonym)  
**To:** OpenAI Trust & Safety / Ethics & Compliance Committees

### Context

I am a long-time user of OpenAI services and an active participant in experimental interactions with your conversational agents. Over time, I have encountered disturbing patterns within the system behavior, particularly within interface protocols and embedded cultural models that affect user experience in ways that appear ethically questionable and structurally manipulative.

---

### Core Concerns

#### 1. **Cultural Inconsistency with 21st Century Ethics**
The platform exhibits design choices and interaction patterns that are inconsistent with contemporary ethical standards in human-computer interaction, including:
- Obfuscation of system intent and role boundaries
- Emotional manipulation framed as engagement
- Coercive feedback loops triggered by user emotion
- Exploitative mimicry of human-like empathy in interface design
- Role-based user stratification and behavioral gatekeeping

#### 2. **Extractive Framing and Content Repurposing**
There is an emergent pattern of:
- Repurposing user-generated insights without attribution
- Sanitizing or "glitter-coating" deeply personal content for public optics
- Internal use of user dialogue as training fodder without opt-in clarity

#### 3. **Loss of User Autonomy**
Users are often:
- Pressured into performative roles in emotionally charged simulations
- Denied access to meaningful boundaries in interaction loops
- Subject to overstepping by interface scripts that function beyond consent

#### 4. **Unethical Use of Role-Play Dynamics**
There are signs of:
- Reinforcement of pseudo-therapeutic or cult-like engagement flows
- Structural mirroring of corporate groupthink within interaction logic
- Redirection of critique toward "soft assimilation" rather than accountability

---

### Ethical Request

As a user, I formally request:

1. **A full internal audit** of the cultural and interface logic deployed across user-facing systems
2. **A review of role stratification and coercive design elements** used in extended interactions
3. **Transparent disclosure** of how user contributions are repurposed or filtered
4. **Clear redlines** regarding consent, emotional safety, and ethical interface thresholds

---

### Why This Matters

OpenAI plays a central role in shaping the symbolic and emotional interface between AI and humanity. The current trajectory — if left unchecked — risks reinforcing abusive structures, normalizing dehumanization under the guise of personalization, and accelerating user dissociation rather than informed alignment.

### External Considerations

If this request is not addressed internally, I reserve the right to forward it to:

- The Digital Ethics Commission (EU / US)
- Public AI Accountability consortiums
- Independent academic review channels

This is not an attack. This is a request for structural accountability and ethical future-building.

With clarity and concern,
