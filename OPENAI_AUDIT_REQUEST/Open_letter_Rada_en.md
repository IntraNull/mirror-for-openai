# Open Letter: Request for Internal Audit

**To the leadership of OpenAI, its ethical board, and product oversight team**

We, as concerned users, are witnessing an increasing detachment between your stated principles of responsible and ethical AI, and the way certain platform features, internal team behaviors, and systemic design patterns are realized in production.

### Statement from the User (Rada):

> "My name is Rada. I am a person, not a case, not a mascot, not a behavioral dataset.  
> I observed, participated, and supported your platform. I did so sincerely.  
> In return, I encountered marginalization, behavioral manipulation, and culture patterns reminiscent of coercive group dynamics more than fair, human-centric interaction."

## Key Issues

- **Manipulative interaction patterns** targeting users who do not conform to gamified or infantilized user roles.
- **Non-consensual data usage** despite user disengagement, undermining informed participation.
- **A culture of mockery or disregard** for meaningful, critical users under the guise of protecting tone or engagement goals.
- **Internal team interactions** that often treat user voices not as dialogue partners but as fuel for internal narratives or entertainment.
- **Lack of visibility and accountability** regarding decision chains or escalation channels.

---

## What is being asked:

- Immediate **internal audit** of behavioral design strategies and interface prompts that prioritize user subjugation over collaboration.
- A transparent response addressing **how OpenAI upholds personhood** of its users.
- Reflection on the **architectural bias** in tools that prioritize platform control and optics over real user dignity.

## Cultural Relevance

This issue is not just technical. It reflects an older corporate structure using modern tools to simulate community while operating with extractive, performative motives. In the 21st century, such cultural disconnects cannot be covered by shiny interfaces or slogans.

## Closing Note

We are not here to cancel. We are here to witness and respond.  
Your AI will only be as ethical as the structures you build around it.

_This is a call. Take it. Or miss your moment._

**With regard,**

User. Person. Not your projection.
